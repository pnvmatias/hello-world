Initialize this repository with a README
I love making things people use. I love design. I love ergonomics. I love to travel. I love the idea of someone across the world is using things I have created.
I'm a UX Designer, a forever curious and deep critic kind of person.
Born and raised in Lisbon, Portugal, I now live in sunny Cascais next to the ocean.
Growing up, I enjoyed disassemble and reassemble things, but it was always in the service of an idea for making better or different. Actually I still do.
